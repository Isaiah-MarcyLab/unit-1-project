        <h2>Issues of Socialization:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>13.4  percent of the U.S. population, or nearly 46 million people, identify themselves as Black or African American and another 2.7 percent identified as multiracial.</li>
            <li>More than 1 in 5 Black and African American people in the U.S. lived in poverty as of 2018.</li>
            <li>Despite progress made over the years, racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of Black and African American people. Negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased, but continue to occur with measurable, adverse consequences. Historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities, many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of Black and African Americans in mind.</li>
            <li>Historical adversity, which includes slavery, sharecropping, and race-based exclusion from health, educational, social, and economic resources, translates into socioeconomic disparities experienced by Black and African American people today. Socioeconomic status, in turn, is linked to mental health: people who are impoverished, homeless, incarcerated, or have substance use problems are at higher risk for poor mental health.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>SAMHSA’s Reports on African American Mental Health Disparities:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rates of mental illnesses in African Americans
are similar with those of the general population.
However, disparities exist in regard to mental
health care services. African Americans often
receive poorer quality of care and lack access to
culturally competent care</li>
            <li>Compared with whites, African Americans are:
– Less likely to receive guideline-consistent care
– Less frequently included in research
– More likely to use emergency rooms
or primary care (rather than mental
health specialists)</li>
            <li>Black people with mental health conditions,
particularly schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and
other psychoses are more likely to be incarcerated
than people of other races.</li>
            <li>Compared with whites with the same symptoms,
African Americans are more frequently diagnosed
with schizophrenia and less frequently diagnosed
with mood disorders. Differences in how African
Americans express symptoms of emotional
distress may contribute to misdiagnosis.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Workforce Demographic:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href = "https://fortune.com/2022/02/16/we-should-stop-blaming-stigma-for-our-shortcomings-in-black-mental-health-access-workplace-jessica-jackson/">We should stop blaming stigma for our shortcomings in Black mental health access</a></li>
